# Riloadr 1.4.3 - Jul 18, 2013

A cross-browser framework-independent responsive images loader.

The goal of this library is to deliver optimized, contextual image sizes in responsive layouts that utilize dramatically different image sizes at different resolutions in order to improve page load time.

## 1. Features

* **No dependencies**: Just Javascript, HTML and CSS (No server involved if you don't want to, no cookies, no .htaccess, no other Javascript library or framework required).
* **Ease of use**: 15-30 mins reading the docs and checking some demos and you're good to go! 
* **Absolute control**: Riloadr will process only the images you tell it to.
* **Unlimited breakpoints**: Set the breakpoints you need. CSS properties available per breakpoint: `minWidth`, `maxWidth`, `minDevicePixelRatio` (plus `fallback` and `imgFormat`).
* **Mimics CSS**: Riloadr computes the viewport's width in CSS pixels and finds out the optimal image size for the viewport according to the breakpoints you set through the `breakpoints` option (sort of CSS media queries).
* **One request per image**: Riloadr does not make multiple requests for the same image.
* **Lazy load of images**: Riloadr gives you the option to defer the load of all images in a group (much better page load times).
* **Full Art Direction**: See `watchViewportWidth` option in the documentation.
* **Legacy content & multiple image sizes**: A fallbacks system allows you to use Riloadr on any website or webapp. [Learn more about fallbacks](#breakpoints).
* **Image groups**: You can create different Riloadr objects and configure each one to your needs (i.e. A group for images in the sidebar and another one for images in the main column).
* **Image retries**: You can configure any Riloadr object to retry *n* times the loading of an image if it failed to load.
* **Useful callbacks**: Riloadr allows you to attach callbacks for the `onload` and `onerror` image events. You can also set an `oncomplete` callback that fires when all images in a group are completely loaded.
* **Bandwidth testing**: Riloadr uses the W3C Network Api to find out wether connection speed is fast enough to deliver Hi-Res images (can be disabled). 
* **Support for browsers with no Javascript support or Javascript disabled**: Use the `noscript` tag OR add and set the `src` attribute with the smallest image (the latter approach may make 2 requests instead of 1, not recommended).
* **No UA sniffing**: Riloadr does not use device detection through user-agents.
* **Lightweight**: 6.2kb minified (4.9kb jQuery version minified)
* **jQuery version available**
* **AMD compatible**
* **MIT License**

## 2. How to use

Riloadr got inspired by the technique used by the [YUI image loader](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/imageloader/).  

The main idea behind this technique is to leave the `src` attribute of `img` tags out of the HTML element altogether and instead use a `data-src` attribute.

This way we avoid making multiple requests to the server for different sizes of an image. Once Riloadr chooses the best size to deliver for the current viewport, it adds the `src` attribute and the image is requested.

**Warning!**:   
Do not set an empty string for the value of src `src=""`.   
Some browsers react to this by assuming the empty string means `src="/"`, and consequently the browser re-requests the current HTML page and tries to stuff it into the`<img>` element. This is bad news for performance.

I'll use some code to explain how to use Riloadr, it should be self explanatory.

```html
<!doctype html>
<!-- 
     Let's add a 'no-js' class to the <html> element so that
     if the browser does not support Javascript, we can target
     in CSS images without an 'src' attribute and remove them 
     from the document flow. 
     Riloadr and Modernizr will remove the 'no-js' class ASAP.
     HTML5 boilerplate uses this technique, so use it!

             Technique 1: <noscript> tag.
             - Pros: 1 request per image.
             - Cons: Cumbersome (You may create a function to print images such as: https://gist.github.com/2689388)
             
             Technique 2: 'src' attribute.
             - Pros: Valid markup, <noscript> tag not needed.
             - Cons: High probability of making 2 requests instead of 1 (worse performance, not recommended).

```

<a name="options"></a>

## 2.1. Configuration options

### base (*String* | Optional)  
An absolute or relative path for all images in a group.

```js
    var group1 = new Riloadr({
        base: 'http://assets.myserver.com/images/'
    });
    
    var group2 = new Riloadr({
        base: 'images/'
    });
```

If `base` is not set, Riloadr will check for the value of the `data-base` attribute of each `img` tag in a group.

```html
    <img class="responsive" data-base="http://assets3.myserver.com/images/" data-src="img_{breakpoint-name}.jpg">
```

If `base` is not set and the `data-base` attribute is missing in an image, Riloadr will use the value of the `data-src` attribute for that image.

```html
    <img class="responsive" data-src="http://assets3.myserver.com/images/img_{breakpoint-name}.jpg">
```

If `base` is set and an image has a `data-base` attribute, the attribute's value overrides the `base` option for that image.

***

### useDataBreak (*Boolean* | Optional)  
Whether to use data-src-{breakpoint-name} to set images for each breakpoint

```js
    var group10 = new Riloadr({
        name: 'group10',
        base: 'images/',
        useDataBreak: true,
        watchViewportWidth: '*',
        breakpoints: [
            {name: 'small', maxWidth: 400},
            {name: 'medium', minWidth: 401},
        ]
    });
```

If `useDataBreak` is not set, Riloadr will use the usual method of using data-src

```html
    <img class="group10" alt="group10 - Waimea" data-src-small="waimea_320.jpg" data-src-medium="waimea_640.jpg">
```

Use of `base` is the same as normal.


***


<a name="breakpoints"></a>

### breakpoints (*Array* | Required)  
The `breakpoints` array works in a similar way to media queries in CSS.  
You can configure as many breakpoints (or size ranges) as you need, just like with media queries.  
A breakpoint is a literal object with up to 6 properties:

* `name` (*String|Integer* | Required): The breakpoint name. You can set the name you prefer for any breakpoint.
* `minWidth` (*Integer* | Optional): Equivalent to `min-width` in CSS media queries. Value should be expressed in CSS pixels.
* `maxWidth` (*Integer* | Optional): Equivalent to `max-width` in CSS media queries. Value should be expressed in CSS pixels.
* `minDevicePixelRatio` (*Float* | Optional): Equivalent to `min-device-pixel-ratio` in CSS media queries (useful for delivering high resolution images). If two breakpoints only differ by this property, the breakpoint containing this property should be placed in the last place.
* `fallback` (*String|Integer* | Optional): An already defined breakpoint `name` to use as a fallback in case the current image size does not exist. Use this feature when an image of a certain size may not exist. Fallbacks do not cascade. Typical use scenarios: 
    * You want to use Riloadr in a website with legacy content (images).
    * You want to use Riloadr in a website where users can upload images that are resized on the server but, depending on the original image size, not all sizes of an image may be created (Flickr for example).
* `imgFormat` (*String* | Optional): You can set a different image file format such as `png` or `jpeg` regardless of the initial image file format you set in the `data-src` attribute. Riloadr will replace the image extension with this one. Just don't include the dot `.`.   

**The `{breakpoint-name}` variable**

The variable `{breakpoint-name}` may be used multiple times in `base`, `data-base` and `data-src` values.  
Riloadr will replace `{breakpoint-name}` by the `name` property of one of the breakpoints you've set.

Let's see some examples:  
Example 1:  

```js
    var group1 = new Riloadr({
        base: '../images/',
        breakpoints: [
            {name: 'xsmall', maxWidth: 320}, // Applied if viewport is not wider than 320 pixels
            {name: 'small',  minWidth: 321, maxWidth: 480},
            {name: 'medium', minWidth: 481, maxWidth: 768},
            {name: 'large',  minWidth: 769, maxWidth: 1024},
            {name: 'xlarge', minWidth: 1025} // Applied if viewport is wider than 1025 pixels
        ]
    });
```

```html
    <!--  
        We add a 'data-src' attribute and the {breakpoint-name} variable where we need it.  
        In this case, image names have a size suffix i.e. wow_small.jpg, wow_xlarge.jpg etc...  
        so we place the {breakpoint-name} variable where the breakpoint name should be.  
    -->  
    <img class="responsive" data-src="wow_{breakpoint-name}.jpg">
```

Example 2:  

```js
    var group2 = new Riloadr({
        base: 'http://myserver.com/photos/{breakpoint-name}/',
        breakpoints: [
            {name: 'mobile',  maxWidth: 320},
            {name: 'tablet',  minWidth: 321, maxWidth: 768},
            {name: 'desktop', minWidth: 769}
        ]
    });
```

```html
    <!-- 
        In this case the {breakpoint-name} variable is used in the 'base' option.
        The final URL for this image will be one of these:
        - http://myserver.com/photos/mobile/super.jpg
        - http://myserver.com/photos/tablet/super.jpg
        - http://myserver.com/photos/desktop/super.jpg
    -->
    <img class="responsive" data-src="super.jpg">
```

Example 3:  

```js
    // Breakpoint names can be used more than once if the breakpoint properties 
    // are different but they apply to the same image size.
    var group3 = new Riloadr({
        base: 'http://img.{breakpoint-name}.myserver.com/',
        breakpoints: [
            {name: 'low',  maxWidth: 320}, // iPhone 3 
            {name: 'high', maxWidth: 320, minDevicePixelRatio: 2}, // iPhone 4 Retina display (High resolution image)
            {name: 'high', minWidth: 321} // Any bigger screen
        ]
    });
```

```html
    <!-- 
        In this case the {breakpoint-name} variable is used in the 'base' option.
        The final URL for this image will be one of these:
        - http://img.low.myserver.com/Hollywood.jpg
        - http://img.high.myserver.com/Hollywood.jpg
    -->
    <img class="responsive" data-src="Hollywood.jpg">
```

Example 4: Let's suppose you want to use Riloadr only to lazy load some images and you don't care about the responsive "thing". Riloadr is so flexible that you could do this:

```js
    var group4 = new Riloadr({
        base: 'http://www.myserver.com/photos/', // Set a base (optional)
        name: 'lazy', // Change the group name (optional)
        defer: 'belowfold',
        breakpoints: [
            {name: 'whatever',  minWidth: 1} // Any screen (here's the trick!)
        ]
    });
```

```html
    <!-- 
        In this case we're not using the {breakpoint-name} variable 
        anywhere because let's pretend we have all images in a single size 
        and we have no plans to dinamically create different versions (sizes) of them.
        
        TADA! You can use Riloadr just as an image loader.

<a name="feature-fallback"></a>
Example 5: How to use fallbacks 

```js
    var group5 = new Riloadr({
        breakpoints: [
            {name: 's', maxWidth: 320}, // All images at this size exist.
            {name: 'm', minWidth: 321, maxWidth: 480, fallback: 's'}, // Some images at this size may not exist so set a fallback to 's' size.
            {name: 'xl', minWidth: 481, maxWidth: 640} // All images at this size exist.
            {name: 'xxl', minWidth: 641, fallback: 'xl'} // Some images at this size may not exist so set a fallback to 'xl' size.
        ]
    });
```

```html
    <!-- 
        The final URL for this image will be one of these:
        - ../Hollywood-s.jpg
        - ../Hollywood-m.jpg or ../Hollywood-s.jpg
        - ../Hollywood-xl.jpg
        - ../Hollywood-xxl.jpg or ../Hollywood-xl.jpg
    -->
    <img class="responsive" data-src="../Hollywood-{breakpoint-name}.jpg">
```

<a name="feature-imgformat"></a>
Example 5: How to use `imgFormat` 

```js
    var group5 = new Riloadr({
        breakpoints: [
            {name: 's', maxWidth: 240, imgFormat: 'png'}, // PNG images
            {name: 'm', minWidth: 241, maxWidth: 320, imgFormat: 'jpg'} // JPG images
        ]
    });
```

```html
    <!-- 
        The final URL for this image will be one of these regardless of the extension set in data-src:
        - ../Hollywood-s.png
        - ../Hollywood-m.jpg
    -->
    <img class="responsive" data-src="../Hollywood-{breakpoint-name}.jpg">
```

**Important!**:   
When Riloadr parses your `breakpoints` it mimics CSS behavior: Riloadr computes the browser's viewport width in CSS pixels, then traverses your breakpoints to find out the appropiate image size to load and makes use of your breakpoint names to get the correct `src` (image URL) to load the image.  
Remember, Riloadr *mimics CSS* and as such, it works with CSS pixels not with device pixels. So when you define your breakpoints use this formula to calculate screen width:  

`device screen width / device pixel ratio = screen width in CSS pixels`  

An example:  
You need to target the iPhone 4 which in portrait mode has a screen width (device pixels) of 640px.
The iPhone 4 has a device pixel ratio of 2 (2 device pixels equal 1 CSS pixel) so if we apply the formula above we get a width of 320 CSS pixels.  
This is the value that you should set as `minWidth` to target the iPhone 3 & 4 (just like in CSS).

***

### defer (*Object* | Optional)  
Tells Riloadr to defer the load of some images.  
Three properties available:  

* `mode` (*String* | Required):
    * `'invisible'`: Images in a group will load when the user is likely to see them (images in the viewport area). Before version 1.4.0, Riloadr only supported the deferred load of images that were "below the fold" but from version 1.4.0 onwards, Riloadr employs a much friendlier bandwidth approach meaning it will only load those images inside the current viewport, thus images outside of the viewport (up, down, left or right) won't get loaded until the user is likely to see them. The image group automatically gets window `scroll`, `resize` and `orientationchange` triggers.
    * `'load'`: Images in a group will be loaded once the window has fully loaded (window.onload).
* `threshold` (*Integer* | Optional):  Each image will be loaded only when it comes within `threshold` pixels of any side of the viewport. If `threshold` is not set, it defaults to `100`px. This option works only with the `invisible` mode.
* `overflownElemsIds` (*Array* | Optional): A list of Ids of elements whose content overflows them. You'll identify these elements in your stylesheet looking for the `overflow` property. If you use the `invisible` mode, please review your stylesheet/html and add those element Ids to this list. This property exists because the `scroll` event does not bubble up and browsers only fire a `scroll` event on `document` and `window` when the user scrolls the entire page. Scrolling overflown content triggers the `scroll` event but it does not bubble up so Riloadr has to know which elements are overflown so that it can register an event listener to them.   

```js
    var group1 = new Riloadr({
        defer: {
            mode: 'invisible',
            threshold: 200,
            overflownElmsIds: ['img-gallery', 'my-overflown-div']
        }
    });

    var group2 = new Riloadr({
        defer: {
            mode: 'load'
        }
    });
```

If `mode` is set to `invisible` and Opera Mini is used, Riloadr falls back to `load` mode. 

***

### ignoreLowBandwidth (*Boolean* | Optional)    
In the case of HiDPI screens, Riloadr will try to find out if the connection speed of the user's device is fast enough to deliver Hi-Res images.   
For that purpose, Riloadr uses the W3C Network Api (both the Working and Editor's Drafts).   
Currently, only a small subset of devices & browsers support this specification although wider support is expected.
   
If a device/browser does not support the Network Api yet, Riloadr assumes a fast connection speed.  

```js
    var group1 = new Riloadr({
        ignoreLowBandwidth: true, // Hi-Res images will be requested regardless of connection speed
        breakpoints: [
			{name: '320px', maxWidth: 320}, // iPhone 3
			{name: '640px', maxWidth: 320, minDevicePixelRatio: 2}, // iPhone 4 Retina display (Hi-Res image)
			{name: '640px', minWidth: 321, maxWidth: 640},
			{name: '1024px', minWidth: 641}
		]
    });
```

If `ignoreLowBandwidth` is not set or is not `true`, it defaults to `false`, meaning Riloadr will only request Hi-Res images if connection speed is fast enough.  

¿What is "fast enough" for Riloadr?  

* Offline mode (no internet connection).
* Bandwidth higher than 100 KB/s. 
* 4g or faster mobile networks (2g & 3g are considered slow for Hi-Res images). 

***

### name (*String* | Optional)    
A name to identify which images Riloadr must process.  
This name must be added to the `class` attribute of each `img` tag in a group.  
When you create a Riloadr object, you're creating an image group.  
You can create different image groups setting a different `name` option for each Riloadr object even if all images share the same `root`. 

```js
    // We're creating 2 image groups that share the same root (body)
    // Each Riloadr object (group) will only process its images (identified by 'name')
    
    var group1 = new Riloadr({
        name: 'group1'
        ...
    });
    
    var group1 = new Riloadr({
        name: 'group2'
        ...
    });
```

```html
    <body>
        <img class="group1 other classes" data-src="img_{breakpoint-name}.jpg">
        <img class="group2 anyother classes" data-src="img_{breakpoint-name}.jpg">
        ...
    </body>
```

Image groups are awesome because you can set different options for different sets of images (i.e. An image group for the main column, another for the sidebar, another for the footer...).  

But, let's go one step further and suppose you want to deliver images from different domains ([Domain sharding](http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2009/05/12/sharding-dominant-domains/)). You can create a group for each domain even if all images share the same `root`, just by setting a different `name` to each group:  

```js
    // Main column ID of your website
    var rootId = 'main-column';
    
    // Both groups share the same 'root' but each group will process 
    // exclusively the images identified by the 'name' option.
    // Use the 'base' option to set the domain for each group
    
    var group1 = new Riloadr({
        base: 'http://img1.example.com/{breakpoint-name}/',
        name: 'sub1',
        root: rootId,
        breakpoints: [ ... ]
    });
    
    var group2 = new Riloadr({
        base: 'http://img2.example.com/{breakpoint-name}/',
        name: 'sub2',
        root: rootId,
        breakpoints: [ ... ]
    });
```

```html
    <!-- HTML -->
    <div id="main-column">
       <img class="sub1" data-src="img1.jpg">
       <img class="sub2" data-src="img2.jpg">
       <img class="sub1" data-src="img3.jpg">
       <img class="sub2" data-src="img4.jpg">
    </div>   
```  

If `name` is not set, Riloadr will look for images with the class `responsive`.  

```html
    <img class="responsive" data-src="img1.jpg">
```

***

### oncomplete (*Function* | Optional)    
Callback function that will be called when all images in a group are completely (down)loaded.  
If an image fails to load it's considered loaded.  
If new images are added dynamically to a group after the `oncomplete` callback is executed, this callback will be executed again once those new images are loaded.

```js
    var group1 = new Riloadr({
        oncomplete: function() {
            console.log("All images loaded");
        }
    });
```

***

### onerror (*Function* | Optional)    
Callback function that will be called if an image fails to load.  
Inside the callback the reserved keyword `this` refers to the image.  
If `retries` is set to a number greater than `0`, Riloadr will automatically try to load that image a maximum of `retries` times. 

```js
    var group1 = new Riloadr({
        onerror: function() {
            console.log(this);
        }
    });
```

***

### onload (*Function* | Optional)  
Callback function that will be called if an image loads successfully.  
Inside the callback the reserved keyword `this` refers to the image.

```js
    var group1 = new Riloadr({
        onload: function() {
            console.log('Image loaded!');
        }
    });
```

***

### retries (*Integer* | Optional)  
Number of times Riloadr must try to load an image if it fails to load.

```js
    var group1 = new Riloadr({
        retries: 2
    });
```

If `retries` is not set, it defaults to `0` (no retries). 

***

### root (*String* | Optional)  
The `id` attribute value of a DOM element (Riloadr uses internally `document.getElementById(root)` to select the element).  
Riloadr will look for images to process in the subtree underneath the specified element, excluding the element itself.  
This option allows you to define a group's scope.  
Use this option to improve image selection performance.  
If `root` is not set or can't be found, it falls back to the `body` element.  

```js
    // Here we're creating 2 groups (Riloadr objects) and each one 
    // has a different 'root'. Although these groups share the same 'name' 
    // (responsive) both are perfectly isolated because their scope is different. 
    
    // 'name' not set, defaults to 'responsive'
    var group1 = new Riloadr({
        base: 'http://{breakpoint-name}.example.com/',
        root: 'main-column',
        breakpoints: [ ... ]
    });
    
    // 'name' not set, defaults to 'responsive'
    var group2 = new Riloadr({
        base: 'http://{breakpoint-name}.example.com/',
        root: 'sidebar',
        breakpoints: [ ... ]
    });
```

```html
    <!-- HTML -->
    <div id="main-column">
       <img class="responsive" data-src="img1.jpg">
       <img class="responsive" data-src="img2.jpg">
    </div> 
    <div id="sidebar">
        <img class="responsive" data-src="img3.jpg">
        <img class="responsive" data-src="img4.jpg">
    </div>
```  

***

### watchViewportWidth (*String* | Optional)  
Enables dynamic Art Direction. 
Ever wished to load different image sizes when users resize their browser? Now you can easily: Define your breakpoints, set `watchViewportWidth` to the mode you prefer and voilá! 
Riloadr provides two different modes of dynamic Art Direction:

* `wider`: Loads larger images as the browser is resized up (One way). Riloadr finds out the widest breakpoint from those you defined for a group and will load larger images as the browser is resized up. When the widest breakpoint is used (largest images get displayed) Riloadr stops watching the viewport meaning images of smaller size won't be loaded.
* `*`: Loads smaller or larger images as the browser is resized down or up respectively (Both ways).

Don't be afraid of enabling this option for mobile devices: Mobile browsers cannot be resized although some of them fire the resize event when certain actions occur but the viewport width isn't likely to change (and that's what matters to Riloadr) so it's safe to assume this setting targets desktop browsers only.

```js
    var group1 = new Riloadr({
        name: 'my-artistic-group',
        breakpoints: [
            {name: '320px', maxWidth: 320},
            {name: '640px', maxWidth: 320, minDevicePixelRatio: 2},
            {name: '640px', minWidth: 321, maxWidth: 640},
            {name: '1024px', minWidth: 641}
        ],
        watchViewportWidth: '*' // Full Art Direction
    });
```
Check the demos to try it ;)

## 2.2. Properties

### version

Contains the version of Riloadr (string).

```js
    console.log( Riloadr.version );
```

<a name="methods"></a>

## 2.3. Methods

### riload()
This method allows you to load responsive images inserted into the document after a group has been created.   
Call this method after new markup is inserted into the document.  
Note this method will load exclusively images belonging to the group (Riloadr object) that invoked `riload()`.

```js
    // Create an image group (root = body)
    var group1 = new Riloadr({
        name: 'resp-images',
        breakpoints: [ ... ]
    });
    
    // Code that adds images to the group's root element (body)
    ...
    
    // After inserting the images, call riload() to load them 
    group1.riload();
```

## 3. jQuery version

If you already use jQuery in a project, save some bytes and use the jQuery version of Riloadr (riloadr.jquery.js & riloadr.jquery.min.js). Same performance, same behavior!  
jQuery 1.3.2+ recommended!  

<a name="demos"></a>

## 4. Demos

Demos are located [here](https://github.com/tubalmartin/riloadr/tree/master/demos).  
Inspect the source code and watch each demo in action, it's the best way to learn how to use Riloadr.  
To run the demos, download the repo, extract the files (optionally upload them to an online server) and open any `demo/*.html` file in your browser.

## 6. Changelog

### 1.4.3

* Bugfix: If an image failed to load, Riloadr tried to load it again if `retries` was set or if a `fallback` breakpoint was provided. The issue here is some browsers such as some Google Chrome versions (28.0.1500.71) do not fire image events after the first time the `src` attribute is set with JS. This is now controlled and works cross-browser.
* Bugfix: Some browsers such as some Google Chrome versions (28.0.1500.71) fire the image `onload` event after the `onerror` or `onabort` events have been fired resulting in unexpected behavior. This is now controlled and works cross-browser.

### 1.4.2

* Bugfix: Resize event listener should only be registered/unregistered when either `defer` mode is `invisible` or `watchViewportWidth` is enabled.
* Fixed minified versions: UglifyJS removed the `new` keyword before `RegExp` and `Error` objects.
